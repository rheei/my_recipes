# Pizza Dough
Makes 2 10" - 12" pizzas

## Ingredients
- `2 cups '00 Pizza Flour`
- `1/8 tsp active dry yeast`
- `1/2 tsp granulated sugar`
- `3/4 cup water` (105 - 115F)

## Instructions
1. Mix the dry ingredients, then add the water. Stir until just combined.
1. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise at room temperature 12-24 hours.
1. Preheat the oven to 500 - 550 F. If you have a pizza stone, let it get to temperature in the oven for a bit before use.
1. Divide the dough in half and transfer to a well floured surface. Stretch and fold by holding onto the dough at both ends, pulling away from each other and folding it back on itself. Repeat so that all four corners of the dough have been stretched and folded.
1. Pull the ends of the dough towards the middle, then turn it over. Pull the dough under itself to make a smooth ball.
1. Cover the dough balls and allow to rise for 45 minutes to an hour.
1. Place the dough on a peel or parchement paper
1. Use your fingertips to gently depress the dough. Lift the pizza from the surface and use your knuckles to gently stretch the dough into a 10" - 12" circle. Make sure everything is floured enough so that it doesn't stick.
1. Add toppings and bake.

## Alternate Recipe

For a shorter rise version, increase the yeast to `1/2 tsp`. After mixing the dough, cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes. After this time, take an edge of the dough, pull, and tuck it into the center (repeat for each side). Cover and allow the dough to rise for at least 8 hours.
